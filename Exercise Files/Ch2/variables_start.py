# Example file for variables

# Declare a variable and initialize it
f=0
print(f)


# re-declaring the variable works



# ERROR: variables of different types cannot be combined



# Global vs. local variables in functions


# global makes f work outside the function throughout the script


# del will delete a value as a function, so the print statement here wont work
